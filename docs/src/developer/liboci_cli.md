# liboci-cli

This crate was separated from original youki crate, and now contains a standalone implementation of structs needed for parsing commandline arguments for OCI-spec compliant runtime commandline interface.

This primarily uses the crate clap-v3 for parsing the actual commandline arguments given to the runtime.
