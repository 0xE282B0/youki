# Good places to start

First of all, welcome to youki! Hope you have fun while developing and contributing :)

This lists some of the known places that are long-running and would be useful for beginners. But as the things under development can change any time, the best place to check for is the issues on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/containers/youki/issues). You can find issues with labels `good fist issue` or `help wanted` and start working on them.

Other that that you can search for `TODO` or `FIXME` comments in the source, and try working on them, but some of them can be hard issues.

This lists known sections that can be good for beginners at the time of the writing. Please update as things change.

#### Documentation Comments

Currently youki is decently commented, and those explain most of the public facing API and structs. But there are still places which can use more doc comments, and examples showing usage, so people can use the docs generated by `cargo doc` as a guide.

If you don't know much about container runtimes or low level system working, then this can be a good place to start, as while going through the code an documenting it, you can learn about it. Make sure that you update this documentation with useful links that you found while commenting some code if it has some peculiar behavior.

#### Integration Tests

You can find more detailed information about this in the integration_test crate, but in brief, we currently use [OCI-runtime-tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) provided integration tests to validate that youki performs as per the OCI spec. But those are written in Go, which makes the developer depend on two language env to compile youki and test it ; as well as those have some issue which make it hard to run them on some local systems.

Thus we are porting those test to Rust, so that it can be an Rust implementation of OCI-runtime integration tests, and easy to run on locacl systems. If you know Go and Rust this can be a great place to start. Check out the [tracking issue](https://github.com/containers/youki/issues/361).
